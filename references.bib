	abstract = {Clustering data by identifying a subset of representative examples is important for processing sensory signals and detecting patterns in data. Such ``exemplars'' can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called ``affinity propagation,'' which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.},

@article{dowlingEtAl20,
	abstract = {Psychology and economics (together known as behavioral economics) are two prominent disciplines underlying many theories in marketing. The extensive marketing literature documents consumers'nonrational behavior even though behavioral biases might not always be consistently termed or formally described. In this review, we identify and synthesize empirical research on behavioral biases in marketing. We document the key findings according to three classes of deviations (i.e., nonstandard preferences, nonstandard beliefs, and nonstandard decision making) and the four phases of consumer purchase decision making (i.e., need recognition, pre-purchase, purchase, and post-purchase). Our organizing framework allows us to (1) synthesize instructive marketing papers in a concise and meaningful manner and (2) identify connections and differences within and across categories in both dimensions. In our review, we discuss specific implications for management and avenues for future research.},

	abstract = {While the attraction effect has received considerable attention in consumer research, recent research concludes that the effect is restricted to artificial choice settings, which questions its relevance for marketing practice. This paper takes a broader perspective on the issue of the generalizability of research results and introduces a set of background factors, which, if neglected, have adverse consequences for such generalizability. The results of our extensive review of the literature on this topic, published during the last four decades in the top 30 marketing journals, show that context effect studies have routinely neglected these background factors. In light of our results, we propose guidelines for implementing context effect experiments in future consumer research. These guidelines allow for a more realistic analysis of the attraction effect and related context effects in consumer research.},

@article{kahnemanTversky79,
	abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.},

@inproceedings{tomlinsonBenson21,
	abstract = {Individuals are constantly making choices---purchasing products, consuming Web content, making social connections---so understanding what contributes to these decisions is crucial in many settings. A major interest is understanding context effects, which occur when the set of available options itself affects an individual's relative preferences. These violate traditional rationality assumptions but are commonly observed in human behavior. At the same time, identifying context effects from choice data remains a challenge; existing models posit a specific context effect a priori and then measure its effect from (often effect-targeting) data. Here, we develop discrete choice models that capture a broad range of context effects, which are learned from choice data rather than baked into the model. Our models yield intuitive, interpretable, and statistically testable context effects, all while being simple to train. We evaluate our model on several empirical choice datasets, discovering, e.g., that people are more willing to book higher-priced hotels when presented with options that are on sale. We also provide the first analysis of context effects in online social network growth, finding that users forming connections place relatively more emphasis on shared neighbors when popular users are an option.},

@article{chernev04,
	abstract = {{Consumers often make decisions based on the extremeness of choice alternatives. Prior research has argued that extremeness aversion is a function of the relational properties of choice alternatives and that the middle option, defined such that its attribute values are between the values of the other alternatives, is always viewed as the least extreme, compromise option. The attribute-balance hypothesis advanced in this article extends prior research, demonstrating that extremeness aversion is also a function of the dispersion of attribute values within each alternative. In particular, it is argued that an option with equal attribute ratings will be perceived as the compromise alternative even when it is not the middle option. Data from three studies support this prediction, offering converging evidence for the attribute-balance effect in different decision contexts. Theoretical implications of the findings are discussed in the context of the extant extremeness aversion research.}},

@article{drolet02,
	abstract = {{The present research demonstrates that consumers tend to vary their use of decision rules independent of option and set characteristics. In five experiments, increased choice of a particular option (e.g., lower price, brand name, or compromise option) was associated with relatively decreased choice of that same (generic) option on occasions that followed. Results indicate that this inherent rule variability is not an effect of background contrast but instead relates to consumers' favorable valuation of decision change itself. This research implies that the idea of contingent decision making applies not only to decision outcomes but also to decision processes.}},

@article{wollschlaegerDiederich20,
	abstract = {{Preference reversals---a decision maker prefers A over B in one situation but B over A in another---demonstrate that human behavior violates invariance assumptions of (utility-based) rational choice theories. In the field of multi-alternative multi-attribute decision-making research, 3 preference reversals received special attention: similarity, attraction, and compromise effects. The 3 so-called context effects are changes in (relative) choice probabilities for 2 choice alternatives after a third ``decoy'' option is added to the set. Despite their simplicity, the effects demonstrate that choice probabilities in multi-alternative decision making are contingent on the local context, that is, on the choice set under consideration. Because of their simplicity, on the other hand, similarity, attraction, and compromise effects have been successfully examined in numerous studies to date, and they have become of increasing interest for differentiating between computational cognitive process models of multi-alternative multi-attribute decision making. However, the stimulus arrangement for producing the effects seems to vary between studies, which becomes challenging when model accounts are compared. The purpose of this review is to present various paradigms in a coherent way and describe various model accounts based on a common structure.}},

In the experiments reported here, we showed that these effects also arise in simple perceptual-decision-making tasks. This finding casts doubt on explanations limited to consumer choice and high-level decisions, and it indicates that context effects may be amenable to a general explanation at the level of the basic decision process. We demonstrated for the first time that three important context effects from the preferential-choice literature---similarity, attraction, and compromise effects---all occurred within a single perceptual-decision task. Not only do our results challenge previous explanations for context effects proposed by consumer researchers, but they also challenge the choice rules assumed in theories of perceptual decision making. },

@article{kivetz04,
	abstract = { The compromise effect denotes the finding that brands gain share when they become the intermediate rather than extreme option in a choice set. Despite the robustness and importance of this phenomenon, choice modelers have neglected to incorporate the compromise effect in formal choice models and to test whether such models outperform the standard value maximization model. In this article, the authors suggest four context-dependent choice models that can conceptually capture the compromise effect. Although the models are motivated by theory from economics and behavioral decision research, they differ with respect to the particular mechanism that underlies the compromise effect (e.g., contextual concavity versus loss aversion). Using two empirical applications, the authors (1) contrast the alternative models and show that incorporating the compromise effect by modeling the local choice context leads to superior predictions and fit compared with the traditional value maximization model and a stronger (naive) model that adjusts for possible biases in utility measurement, (2) generalize the compromise effect by demonstrating that it systematically affects choice in larger sets of products and attributes than has been previously shown, (3) show the theoretical and empirical equivalence of loss aversion and local (contextual) concavity and (4) demonstrate the superiority of models that use a single reference point over ``tournament models'' in which each option serves as a reference point. They discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this research as well as the ability of the proposed models to predict other behavioral context effects. },

	abstract = { In this article, the author proposes and applies an empirical two-stage choice model to Internet clickstream data that captures observed choices for two choice stages: products viewed and products purchased. The model allows for interdependences between choices within a stage as well as the use of varying decision rules in each stage. The author accommodates heterogeneity in preferences and in decision rules. The proposed model uses observed choices to infer both attribute preference ratings and criterion attributes. The results show empirically, in a field setting, that the product attributes evaluated in Stage 1 differ from those evaluated in Stage 2. Consistent with existing theory, consumers tend to use simpler decision rules based on a subset of attribute information in earlier stages. The author also finds some preliminary evidence that attributes such as price and size tend to be considered in only one of the two stages, whereas ingredient attributes tend to be considered in both stages. From a managerial perspective, the identification of criterion attributes, coupled with the preference parameters estimated by the model, can assist with the targeting and positioning of promotional strategies. },

@article{roodrkerkEtAl11,
	abstract = { The behavioral literature provides ample evidence that consumer preferences are partly driven by the context provided by the set of alternatives. Three important context effects are the compromise, attraction, and similarity effects. Because these context effects affect choices in a systematic and predictable way, it should be possible to incorporate them in a choice model. However, the literature does not offer such a choice model. This study fills this gap by proposing a discrete-choice model that decomposes a product's utility into a context-free partworth utility and a context-dependent component capturing all three context effects. Model estimation results on choice-based conjoint data involving digital cameras provide convincing statistical evidence for context effects. The estimated context effects are consistent with the predictions from the behavioral literature, and accounting for context effects leads to better predictions both in and out of sample. To illustrate the benefit from incorporating context effects in a choice model, the authors discuss how firms could utilize the context sensitivity of consumers to design more profitable product lines. },

	abstract = { Consumer research has documented dozens of instances in which the introduction of an ``irrelevant'' third option affects preferences between the remaining two. In nearly all such cases, the unattractive dominated option enhances the attractiveness of the option it most resembles---a phenomenon known as the ``attraction effect.'' In the studies presented here, however, the authors contend that this phenomenon may be restricted to stylized product representations in which every product dimension is represented by a number (e.g., a toaster oven that has a durability rating of 7.2 and ease of cleaning rating of 5.5). Such effects do not typically occur when consumers experience the product (e.g., taste a drink) or when even one of the product attributes is represented perceptually (e.g., differently priced hotel rooms whose quality is depicted with a photo). The authors posit that perceptual representations of attributes do not support the sorts of comparisons that drive the attraction effect with highly stylized examples, and they question the practical significance of the effect. },

Choice probabilities derived with independent errors have the property of independence of irrelevant alternatives, which often does not match observed substitution behavior and leads to inaccurate calculations of source of volume when new entrants are introduced. In this article, the authors parameterize the covariance matrix for a probit model so that similar brands in the preference space have higher correlation than dissimilar brands, resulting in higher rates of substitution. They find across multiple data sets that similarity based on overall utility, not just attributes, defines products as similar with heightened rates of substitution. The proposed model results in better in-sample and predictive fits to the data and more realistic measures of substitution for a new product introduction. },

They propose that context effects resulting from the addition of a third option to a two-option set are more frequently observed when the added option is relatively similar (adjacent) to the ``disadvantaged'' alternative (i.e., the lower-share option) in the set.

@article{orhun09,
	abstract = { In a market of consumers with varying willingness to pay, using product line as a discrimination tool may extract higher profits than serving all consumers with a single product. Local context effects, however, point to yet another consideration in designing product lines: how the appeal of a product changes with the context provided by other products in the choice set. I present a model of product line design that incorporates both discrimination and context management goals and offers recommendations for the variety and positioning of products. To this end, the model makes use of a framework that allows preferences to be choice set dependent. Given this framework, I study how the firm manages externalities between products created by such dependencies. The firm creates distortions above and beyond those resulting from discrimination motives alone. For example, in a vertically differentiated market for quality, quality distortions exist even for the consumers with the highest valuations. The range of quality provisions, given the number of products, is compressed as the relative importance of unfavorable comparisons among products increases. Surprisingly, this compression may even lead the firm to forego discrimination among consumers regardless of the cost of offering distinct products. },

Despite its simplicity and intuitive appeal, there is a growing body of data that is inconsistent with this theory. In particular, the relative attractiveness of x compared to y often depends on the presence or absence of a third option z, and the ``market share'' of an option can actually be increased by enlarging the offered set. We review recent empirical findings that are inconsistent with value maximization, and present a context-dependent model that expresses the value of each option as an additive combination of two components: a contingent weighting process that captures the effect of the background context, and a binary comparison process that describes the effect of the local context. The model accounts for observed violations of the standard theory and provides a framework for analyzing context-dependent preferences. },

However, such product recommendations can not only support but also influence decision-making and outcomes. Expanding on previous research on the persuasiveness of product recommendations, this paper demonstrates that recommender systems can affect online decision-making through an anchoring effect such that consumers' decision-making processes and, ultimately, choices are biased toward numerical attributes of (even random) product recommendations; we refer to this phenomenon as attribute-level anchoring effect. The findings of the current research reveal that this effect occurs because consumers tend to pay more attention to alternatives that are similar to a recommended option. From a practical perspective, these results indicate the potential to shape consumer interests and choices through recommender systems and highlight possible customer protection issues in online shopping environments.},

	abstract = {Several studies have shown that consumer choice is often influenced by the context or the set of alternatives under consideration. Context effects have largely been explained in terms of constructive preferences that are consistent with 2 theoretical accounts---effort minimization and perceptual contrast---that emphasize different underlying motivations. We propose that the effect of time pressure on context effects can be used as a moderating variable to determine which of the 2 motives is supported. Specifically, if context effects bias preferences due to effort minimization, time pressure should increase the magnitude of such effects. In contrast, if context effects arise due to an excessive focus on the relational characteristics of the alternatives provided, time pressure should reduce the magnitude of such effects. We examine this proposition in relation to the compromise effect and a choice between an extreme and an all-average option. We find that the compromise effect and the preference for an all-average alternative are both reduced under time pressure. A study using Mouselab provides additional support for the underlying decision mechanisms. We discuss the theoretical implications of this research and explore its consequences for marketers.},

This research examines how maximizing affects the compromise effect: the preference for an option with relatively intermediate attribute values. Results show that maximizers attempt to maximize gains on all attributes (rather than to rely on a single, most important attribute as satisficers do) and make more compensatory tradeoffs, which leads to more often choosing a compromise option (Studies 2 \& 3). Results held whether maximization was measured as an individual difference variable (Studies 1 \& 2) or activated as a decision mindset (Study 3). When asked to make decisions for a (fictional) prototypical maximizer, however, people intuited fewer compromise choices (Study 4).

	abstract = {Since the introduction of Discrete Choice Analysis, countless efforts have been made to enhance the efficiency of data collection through choice experiments and to improve the behavioural realism of choice models. One example development in data collection are best-worst discrete choice experiments (BWDCE), which have the benefit of obtaining a larger number of observations per respondent, allowing for reliably estimating choice models even with smaller samples. In SWDCE, respondents are asked to alternatingly select the `best'/`worst' alternatives, until the choice set is exhausted. The use of BWDCE raises the question of decision-rule consistency through the stages of the experiment. We challenge the notion that the same fully compensatory decision rule is utilised throughout the experiment. We hypothesize that respondents may utilise one decision rule for selecting the `best' and another for selecting the `worst' alternatives. To test our hypothesis, we developed a model that combines the SBWMNL model for modelling best-worst data and the μRRM model that can account for variations in decision rules. Our results show that decision-rule heterogeneity does seem to be present in BWDCE: it is more likely that `best' choices are made using a fully compensatory decision rule (maximising utility), whereas `worst' choices are more likely made using a non-compensatory decision rule (minimising regret). Such behaviour is largely similar to how image theory describes the decision-making process in complex situations. Our findings give choice modellers new insight into the behaviour of respondents in best-worst experiments and allows them to represent their behaviour more accurately.},

We examine why knowledge worker ego networks are structured as they are, but also why and how knowledge worker networks change over time. We examine two changes to knowledge workers' ego networks: the addition of new direct exchange partners and the deletion of existing direct exchange partners. Our study offers important evidence that two network dimensions (tie strength between ego and his or her alters, and the level of connectivity among ego's alters) provide distinctive insight into how networks change. Importantly, our study provides evidence that three critical components of the knowledge creation process---access to diverse and redundant resources, shared experiences and tacit mutual understanding to develop the resources, and previous knowledge creations---act as causal mechanisms behind network changes in subsequent periods. Our study is at the individual level as we study biomedical research scientists and their direct exchange partners---the others to whom they are directly connected through coauthorship. },

	abstract = {Abstract In recent decades, co-authorship and policies aimed at inducing academic collaboration have increased simultaneously. Assuming that intellectual collaboration is exogenously determined, prior studies found a negative relationship between co-authorship and productivity. I examine a panel data on economists publishing from 1970 to 2011 to test the causal effect of intellectual collaboration on intellectual output. As characteristics of the individual and her opportunity set are endogenously related to both collaboration and productivity, I instrument the amount of co-authorship by the common research interest between an author and her potential co-authors. After controlling for endogenous co-authorship formation, unobservable heterogeneity and time varying factors, the effect of intellectual collaboration on individual performance becomes positive.},

abstract = {Abstract This study investigates the role of consideration sets in brand choice. Brand-level aggregated data are used to capture the responses of consumers who face a number of international and domestic brands in markets rather than two or three brands in experimental designs, as in Chaudhuri and Holbrook (2001). Empirical evidence from path analysis shows that the consideration set for hedonic products includes a smaller number of dominant brands, whereas the consideration set for utilitarian products includes more and diverse brands. The probability of being finally chosen from the consideration set differs according to product characteristics: hedonic vs. utilitarian. The authors discuss managerial implications and suggestions for future research. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

    abstract = { Although evidence-based algorithms consistently outperform human forecasters, people often fail to use them after learning that they are imperfect, a phenomenon known as algorithm aversion. In this paper, we present three studies investigating how to reduce algorithm aversion. In incentivized forecasting tasks, participants chose between using their own forecasts or those of an algorithm that was built by experts. Participants were considerably more likely to choose to use an imperfect algorithm when they could modify its forecasts, and they performed better as a result. Notably, the preference for modifiable algorithms held even when participants were severely restricted in the modifications they could make (Studies 1–3). In fact, our results suggest that participants' preference for modifiable algorithms was indicative of a desire for some control over the forecasting outcome, and not for a desire for greater control over the forecasting outcome, as participants' preference for modifiable algorithms was relatively insensitive to the magnitude of the modifications they were able to make (Study 2). Additionally, we found that giving participants the freedom to modify an imperfect algorithm made them feel more satisfied with the forecasting process, more likely to believe that the algorithm was superior, and more likely to choose to use an algorithm to make subsequent forecasts (Study 3). This research suggests that one can reduce algorithm aversion by giving people some control—even a slight amount—over an imperfect algorithm's forecast.

Prior research has focused largely on computational approaches to improving recommendation accuracy, and only recently researchers have started to study their behavioral implications and potential side effects. We used three controlled experiments, in the context of purchasing digital songs, to explore the willingness-to-pay judgments of individual consumers after being shown personalized recommendations. In Study 1, we found strong evidence that randomly assigned song recommendations affected participants' willingness to pay, even when controlling for participants' preferences and demographics. In Study 2, participants viewed actual system-generated recommendations that were intentionally perturbed (introducing recommendation error), and we observed similar effects. In Study 3, we showed that the influence of personalized recommendations on willingness-to-pay judgments was obtained even when preference uncertainty was reduced through immediate and mandatory song sampling prior to pricing. The results demonstrate the existence of important economic side effects of personalized recommender systems and inform our understanding of how system recommendations can influence our everyday preference judgments. The findings have significant implications for the design and application of recommender systems as well as for online retail practices.},

Specifically, the display of system-predicted preference ratings as item recommendations has been shown in multiple studies to bias users' preference ratings after item consumption in the direction of the predicted rating. Top-N lists represent another common approach for presenting item recommendations in recommender systems. Through three controlled laboratory experiments, we show that top-N lists do not induce a discernible bias in user preference judgments. This result is robust, holding for both lists of personalized item recommendations and lists of items that are top-rated based on averages of aggregate user ratings. Adding numerical ratings to the list items does generate a bias, consistent with earlier studies. Thus, in contexts where preference biases are of concern to an online retailer or platform, top-N lists, without numerical predicted ratings, would be a promising format for displaying item recommendations.},

Bearing in mind this gap in the research, we apply the technology acceptance model (TAM) to evaluate user acceptance of a recommender system in the movies domain. Within the basic TAM model, we incorporate a new latent variable representing self-assessed user skills to use a recommender system. The experiment included 116 users who answered a satisfaction survey after using a movie recommender system. The results evince that perceived usefulness of the system has more impact than perceived ease of use to motivate acceptance of recommendations. Additionally, users' previous skills strongly influence perceived ease of use, which directly impacts on perceived usefulness of the system. These findings can assist developers of recommender systems in their attempt to maximize users' experience.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, driven also by the availability of an unprecedented computational power and storage capabilities in cloud environments, we assisted to the proliferation of new algorithms, methods, and approaches in two areas of artificial intelligence: knowledge representation and machine learning. On the one side, the generation of a high rate of structured data on the Web led to the creation and publication of the so-called knowledge graphs. On the other side, deep learning emerged as one of the most promising approaches in the generation and training of models that can be applied to a wide variety of application fields. More recently, autoencoders have proven their strength in various scenarios, playing a fundamental role in unsupervised learning. In this paper, we instigate how to exploit the semantic information encoded in a knowledge graph to build connections between units in a Neural Network, thus leading to a new method, SEM-AUTO, to extract and weight semantic features that can eventually be used to build a recommender system. As adding content-based side information may mitigate the cold user problems, we tested how our approach behaves in the presence of a few ratings from a user on the Movielens 1M dataset and compare results with BPRSLIM.},

After several years of research and industrial findings looking after better algorithms to improve accuracy and diversity metrics, explanation services for recommendation are gaining momentum as a tool to provide a human-understandable feedback to results computed, in most of the cases, by black-box machine learning techniques. As a matter of fact, explanations may guarantee users satisfaction, trust, and loyalty in a system. In this paper, we evaluate how different information encoded in a Knowledge Graph are perceived by users when they are adopted to show them an explanation. More precisely, we compare how the use of categorical information, factual one or a mixture of them both in building explanations, affect explanatory criteria for a recommender system. Experimental results are validated through an A/B testing platform which uses a recommendation engine based on a Semantics-Aware Autoencoder to build users profiles which are in turn exploited to compute recommendation lists and to provide an explanation.},

  pages = {110},
  abstract = {In recommender systems, the concept of control is associated with ways users can manipulate the system through interactions or by defining parameters in order to be provided more personal and better recommendations. Other studies in the movie domain have found that users may have a divergent perception of similarity regarding which features are important to them when looking for similar movies. This thesis sets out to investigate if these divergent opinions on similarity can be leveraged by controllability in the multi-lists presentation of recommendations. This thesis shows that user control did not appear to be evaluated more positively than a non-control recommender system for the average participant. This thesis found that multi lists presentation of recommendations without control were generally evaluated better than with control by performing a quantitative conditional user evaluation of the recommender system. When looking at participants' demographic properties, it may be that some subgroups consisting of users with a higher level of domain knowledge or similar system experience may favor control. Furthermore, no significant variances between the three list sort methods that the system uses to enforce the users' control were discovered. As controllability in recommender systems have not been extensively evaluated in the research corpus, this thesis hopes to be a starting point that can inspire future studies to attempt other novel approaches in implementing and evaluating controllability in the multi-lists presentation of recommendations to achieve more positive results.},

The results show that larger sets containing only good items do not necessarily result in higher choice satisfaction compared to smaller sets, as the increased recommendation set attractiveness is counteracted by the increased difficulty of choosing from these sets. These findings were supported by behavioral measurements revealing intensified information search and increased acquisition times for these large attractive sets.

  abstract = {Customer behavior is often assumed to follow weak rationality, which implies that adding a product to an assortment will not increase the choice probability of another product in that assortment. However, an increasing amount of research has revealed that customers are not necessarily rational when making decisions. In this paper, we propose a new nonparametric choice model that relaxes this assumption and can model a wider range of customer behavior, such as decoy effects between products. In this model, each customer type is associated with a binary decision tree, which represents a decision process for making a purchase based on checking for the existence of specific products in the assortment. Together with a probability distribution over customer types, we show that the resulting model -- a decision forest -- is able to represent any customer choice model, including models that are inconsistent with weak rationality. We theoretically characterize the depth of the forest needed to fit a data set of historical assortments and prove that with high probability, a forest whose depth scales logarithmically in the number of assortments is sufficient to fit most data sets. We also propose two practical algorithms -- one based on column generation and one based on random sampling -- for estimating such models from data. Using synthetic data and real transaction data exhibiting non-rational behavior, we show that the model outperforms both rational and non-rational benchmark models in out-of-sample predictive ability.},

This study, via re-appraising the conception of decision quality, subjective state towards decision, and threshold of information load, proposes an extended model, considering the roles of information filtering mechanisms, on-line shopping experience, and perceived information overload, to examine the effects of information load on subjective state towards decision. An experiment was conducted to test the research model. The results indicate that rich information leads to a perception of high information overload; and the latter lead consumers to a worse subject state towards decision. Information filtering tools and on-line shopping experience may have influences on relieving but are not the panacea to the phenomenon of information overload.

Therefore, more effort has been made in recent years to develop recommender systems that recommend products or services to users so as to assist in their decision-making process. In this article, we describe crucial experimental results about a novel recommender technology, called the               preference-based organization               (Pref-ORG), which generates critique suggestions in addition to recommendations according to users' preferences. The critique is a form of feedback (``I would like something cheaper than this one'') that users can provide to the currently displayed product, with which the system may better predict what the user truly wants. We compare the               preference-based organization               technique with related approaches, including the ones that also produce critique candidates, but without the consideration of user preferences. A simulation setup is first presented, that identified Pref-ORG's significantly higher algorithm accuracy in predicting critiques and choices that users should intend to make, followed by a real-user evaluation which practically verified its significant impact on saving users' decision effort.},

We further show that each of these four factors has a reliable and significant impact on choice overload, whereby higher levels of decision task difficulty, greater choice set complexity, higher preference uncertainty, and a more prominent, effort-minimizing goal facilitate choice overload. We also find that four of the measures of choice overload used in prior research\textemdash satisfaction/confidence, regret, choice deferral, and switching likelihood\textemdash are equally powerful measures of choice overload and can be used interchangeably. Finally, we document that when moderating variables are taken into account the overall effect of assortment size on choice overload is significant\textemdash a finding counter to the data reported by prior meta-analytic research.},

  abstract = {Recommender Systems (RSs) help users search large amounts of digital contents and services by allowing them to identify the items that are likely to be more attractive or useful. RSs play an important persuasion role, as they can potentially augment the users' trust towards in an application and orient their decisions or actions towards specific directions. This article explores the persuasiveness of RSs, presenting two vast empirical studies that address a number of research questions.             First, we investigate if a design property of RSs, defined by the statistically measured quality of algorithms, is a reliable predictor of their potential for persuasion. This factor is measured in terms of perceived quality, defined by the overall satisfaction, as well as by how users judge the accuracy and novelty of recommendations. For our purposes, we designed an empirical study involving 210 subjects and implemented seven full-sized versions of a commercial RS, each one using the same interface and dataset (a subset of Netflix), but each with a different recommender algorithm. In each experimental configuration we computed the statistical quality (recall and F-measures) and collected data regarding the quality perceived by 30 users. The results show us that algorithmic attributes are less crucial than we might expect in determining the user's perception of an RS's quality, and suggest that the user's judgment and attitude towards a recommender are likely to be more affected by factors related to the user experience.             Second, we explore the persuasiveness of RSs in the context of large interactive TV services. We report a study aimed at assessing whether measurable persuasion effects (e.g., changes of shopping behavior) can be achieved through the introduction of a recommender. Our data, collected for more than one year, allow us to conclude that, (1) the adoption of an RS can affect both the lift factor and the conversion rate, determining an increased volume of sales and influencing the user's decision to actually buy one of the recommended products, (2) the introduction of an RS tends to diversify purchases and orient users towards less obvious choices (the long tail), and (3) the perceived novelty of recommendations is likely to be more influential than their perceived accuracy.             Overall, the results of these studies improve our understanding of the persuasion phenomena induced by RSs, and have implications that can be of interest to academic scholars, designers, and adopters of this class of systems.},

  abstract = {Valid measurement scales for predicting user acceptance of computers are in short supply. Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of.98 for usefulness and.94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.},

When the systems are deployed, these models determine the availability of content and information to different users. The gap between these objectives gives rise to a potential for unintended consequences, contributing to phenomena such as filter bubbles and polarization. In this work, we consider directly the information availability problem through the lens of user recourse. Using ideas of reachability, we propose a computationally efficient audit for top-N linear recommender models. Furthermore, we describe the relationship between model complexity and the effort necessary for users to exert control over their recommendations. We use this insight to provide a novel perspective on the user cold-start problem. Finally, we demonstrate these concepts with an empirical investigation of a state-of-the-art model trained on a widely used movie ratings dataset.},

Choice set size was operationalized through 3-, 9-, and 30hotel room choice sets. Through experimental design, this study shows that the presence of an information filtering mechanism reduces consumers' perceptions of choice overload with a large number of choices (30 choices), whereas its impact is attenuated with smaller choice sets (3 and 9 choices). In addition, choice overload mediates the impact of choice set size on decision confidence. Theoretical contribution and managerial implications are also discussed.},

  abstract = {This research examines the impact of defaults on product choice in sequential-decision settings. Whereas prior research has shown that a default can affect what consumers purchase by promoting choice of the preselected option, the influence of defaults is more nuanced when consumers make a series of related choices. In such a setting, consumer preferences may evolve across choices due to ?spillover? effects from one choice to subsequent choices. The authors hypothesize that defaults systematically attenuate choice spillover effects because accepting a default is a more passive process than either choosing a nondefault option in the presence of a default or making a choice in the absence of a default. Three experiments and a field study provide compelling evidence for such default-induced changes in choice spillover effects. The findings show that firms? setting of high-price defaults with the aim of influencing consumers to choose more expensive products can backfire through the attenuation of spillover. In addition to advancing the understanding of the interplay between defaults and preference dynamics, insights from this research have important practical implications for firms applying defaults in sequential choices.},

  abstract = {The decoy effect reveals a potential violation of the regularity assumption, which is a building block of canonical discrete choice models. This effect has been detected in various choice con\- texts, but the susceptibility to it and its subjective valuation have been scarcely studied before. This paper proposes, illustrates and assesses two methodologies aimed to fill this gap: systematic taste variations and latent classes. The first approach uses a logit model that accounts for the decoy effect by an emergent value term which coefficient varies among groups of individuals defined by exogenous variables. The second method uses a similar scheme but accounts for heterogeneity, instead, by using three variations of the latent classes approach. This article il\- lustrates and assesses the proposed methods using a case study build from a stated preferences route choice problem that depicts a hypothetical Saturday afternoon car shopping trip. Results show first that both methods are feasible for analyzing the decoy effect and that only respondent's age and response time seem to play a clear role in decoy's susceptibility in the case study. On the contrary, no noticeable impact on susceptibility is detected for gender, imputed income, motor\- ization rate, household size and whether the survey was conducted in person or online. Finally, regarding decoy's subjective valuation, evidence from this case study suggests that presenting the decoy was, on average, as large as reducing about one fourth of the travel time, or between one fourth and one half of the travel cost displayed to the interviewees.},

This research explores how companies should frame the methods they use to derive their recommendations, in an attempt to maximize click-through rates.

User-based framing emphasizes the similarity between customers (e.g., ``People who like this also like\ldots ''); item-based framing instead emphasizes similarities between products (e.g., ``Similar to this item''). Six experiments, including two field experiments within a mobile app, show that framing the same recommendation as user-based (vs. item-based) can increase recommendation click-through rates. The findings suggest that user-based (vs. item-based) framing informs customers that the recommendation is based on not just product matching but also taste matching with other customers. Three theoretically derived and practically relevant boundary conditions related to the recommendation recipient, the products, and other users also offer practical guidance for managers regarding how to leverage recommendation framings to increase recommendation click-throughs.},

We hypothesize that any recommender algorithm will better fit some users' expectations than others, leaving opportunities for improvement. To address this challenge, we study a recommender that puts some control in the hands of users. Specifically, we build and evaluate a system that incorporates user-tuned popularity and recency modifiers, allowing users to express concepts like ``show more popular items''. We find that users who are given these controls evaluate the resulting recommendations much more positively. Further, we find that users diverge in their preferred settings, confirming the importance of giving control to users.},

  abstract = {Results of recent studies point towards a new framework for the neural bases of economic choice. The principles of this framework include the idea that evaluation is limited to a single option within the focus of attention and that we accept or reject that option relative to the entire set of alternatives. Rejection leads attention to a new option, although it can later switch back to a previously rejected one. The option to which a neuron?s firing rate refers is determined dynamically by attention and not stably by labelled lines. Value is always computed relative to the value of rejection. Comparison results not from explicit competition between discrete populations of neurons, but indirectly, as in a horse race, from the fact that the first option whose value crosses a threshold is selected. Consequently, comparison can occur within a single pool of neurons rather than by competition between two or more neuronal populations. The computations that constitute comparison thus occur at multiple levels, including premotor levels, simultaneously (i.e. the brain uses a distributed consensus), and not in discrete stages. This framework suggests a solution to a set of otherwise unresolved neuronal binding problems that result from the need to link options to values, comparisons to actions, and choices to outcomes.},

  abstract = {A large amount of research on recommender systems has focused on improving the accuracy of suggestions in offline settings. However, this focus and the commonly used techniques can lead to a ``filter bubble'', severely limiting the diversity of content discovered by users. Several offline studies show that this can be mitigated by using experts for recommendation. In contrast to standard recommender systems, experts are able to generate more diverse recommendations and increase the novelty of given suggestions. They can be used in missing-data or cold-start scenarios and reduce noise in the users' ratings. This paper examines the impact of employed experts' recommendations on user behavior for a real-world recommender system on a popular video-on-demand website, provided by a large television network. We study whether the potential benefits of experts lead to differences in user behavior, user perceptions and properties of given recommendations (e.g., diversity). We find that enriching a state-of-the-art system with the suggestions of employed experts can significantly increase platform use. Even though expert recommendations are used less frequently and are less successful than ex\- pected, users watch a greater number of clips, use more recommendations, and come back to the website more frequently when they receive expert suggestions. When searching for other influencing factors, we find that experts generate more diverse recommendations and improve the taste coverage of the system keeping user satisfaction unaffected. In summary, our results show large benefits of using employed experts and have im\- plications for the design and use of recommender systems in real-world scenarios.},

However, it has been reported that user satisfaction does not necessarily increase even when a recommender system recommends items high precision. User satisfaction is considered to be influenced by many factors. Among these factors, we focus in particular on user intervention. User intervention is a user control over a recommender system. We provide three hypotheses: i) user intervention in the recommendation process itself improves the user satisfaction, ii) user intervention improves the user satisfaction when the intervention is reflected in the recommendation results, and iii) the degree of improvement in user satisfaction differs among the types of user interventions applied. In this study, we conducted a user experiment using several kinds of interventions, and clarify the relationship between user intervention and user satisfaction.},

We illustrate the application of the guidelines by constructing and comparing various context-specific variations of the technology acceptance model (TAM)\textemdash i.e., the decomposed TAM that incorporates interaction effects between context-specific factors, the extended TAM with context-specific antecedents, and the integrated TAM that incorporates mediated moderation and moderated mediation effects of context-specific factors. We tested the models on 972 individuals in two technology usage contexts: a digital library and an agile Web portal. The results show that the decomposed TAM provides a better understanding of the contexts by revealing the direct and interaction effects of context-specific factors on behavioral intention that are not mediated by the TAM constructs of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. This work contributes to the ongoing discussion about the importance of context in theory development and provides guidance for context-specific theorizing in IS research.},

We define LoR as the cost of approximating the observed choice fractions from a collection of offer sets with those from the best-fitting probability distribution over rankings. Computing LoR is intractable in the worst case. To deal with this challenge, we introduce two new concepts, rational separation and choice graph, through which we reduce the problem to solving a dynamic program on the choice graph and express the computational complexity in terms of the structural properties of the graph. By exploiting the graph structure, we provide practical methods to compute LoR efficiently for a large class of applications. We apply our methods to real-world grocery sales data and identify product categories for which going beyond rational choice models is necessary to obtain an acceptable performance.},

This paper presents an empirical study of the trade-offs involved in an attempt to ensure a suitable degree of controllability. Within an adaptive hotlist for a conference web site, two mechanisms for providing users with recommendations of conference events were compared: automatic vs. controlled updating of recommendations. In an experimental setting, each of 18 users worked with both variants of the adaptive hotlist, as well as with a nonadaptive variant. The users differed markedly in their responses to automatic vs. controlled updating. A number of reasons for these differences could be found in the objective and subjective data yielded by the study. The study illustrates how preferences for different forms of user control can be influenced by factors ranging from stable individual differences to unpredictable features of a situation. General implications for the design of controllable adaptive systems are discussed.},

These systems thereby influence which information is easily accessible to us and thus affect our decision-making processes though the automated selection and ranking of the presented content. Automated recommendations can therefore be seen as digital nudges, because they determine different aspects of the choice architecture for users. In this work, we examine the relationship between digital nudging and recommender systems, topics that so far were mostly investigated in isolation. Through a systematic literature search, we first identified 87 nudging mechanisms, which we categorize in a novel taxonomy. A subsequent analysis then shows that only a small part of these nudging mechanisms was previously investigated in the context of recommender systems. This indicates that there is a huge potential to develop future recommender systems that leverage the power of digital nudging in order to influence the decision-making of users. In this work, we therefore outline potential ways of integrating nudging mechanisms into recommender systems.},

However, providing additional controls also increases cognitive load, and different users have different needs for control. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the effect of two personal characteristics: musical sophistication and visual memory capacity. We designed a visual user interface, on top of a commercial music recommender, with different controls: interactions with recommendations (i.e., the output of a recommender system), the user profile (i.e., the top listened songs), and algorithm parameters (i.e., weights in an algorithm). We created eight experimental settings with combinations of these three user controls and conducted a between-subjects study (N=240), to explore the effect on cognitive load and recommendation acceptance for different personal characteristics. We found that controlling recommendations is the most favorable single control element. In addition, controlling user profile and algorithm parameters was the most beneficial setting with multiple controls. Moreover, the participants with high musical sophistication perceived recommendations to be of higher quality, which in turn lead to higher recommendation acceptance. However, we found no effect of visual working memory on either cognitive load or recommendation acceptance. This work contributes an understanding of how to design control that hits the sweet spot between the perceived quality of recommendations and acceptable cognitive load.},

Often, no mechanisms are implemented for users to give the system feedback on the recommendations or to explicitly specify preferences, which can limit the potential overall value of the system for its users.             Academic research in recommender systems is largely focused on algorithmic approaches for item selection and ranking.

Evaluating the determinants of acceptance of information technology (IT) is vital to address the problem of underutilization and leverage the benefits of IT investments, especially for more radical technologies. This study examines individual acceptance of biometric identification techniques in a voluntary environment, measuring the intention to accept and further recommend the technology resulting from a carefully selected set of variables. Drawing on elements of technology acceptance model (TAM), diffusion of innovations (DOI) and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) along with the trust-privacy research field, we propose an integrated approach that is both theoretically and empirically grounded. By testing some of the most relevant and well-tested elements from previous models along with new antecedents to biometric system adoption, this study produces results which are both sturdy and innovative. We first confirm the influence of renowned technology acceptance variables such as compatibility, perceived usefulness, facilitating conditions on biometrics systems acceptance and further recommendation. Second, prior factors such as concern for privacy, trust in the technology, and innovativeness also prove to have an influence. Third, unless innovativeness, the most important drivers to explain biometrics acceptance and recommendation are not from the traditional adoption models (TAM, DOI, and UTAUT) but from the trust and privacy literature (trust in technology and perceived risk). \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The benefits of recommendation systems in online retail contexts have received much attention in prior work. Much of this work has been conducted in personal computer (PC)\textendash based settings, although mobile devices are becoming increasingly central to the online shopping experience. It remains to be examined if the effects of recommendation systems in retail differ across these two channels, in terms of customer-level decision outcomes. In this paper, we examine these differences in some detail, studying how product views and sales attributed to a recommendation system are different across mobile and PC-based channels. Further, we examine how the effect of a recommendation system across channels influences sales diversity, an important outcome in the retail industry. We conduct our analysis using a randomized field experiment, conducted in partnership with an online retailing firm in South Korea, where the experimental treatment is access to a recommendation system. Our results show that the use of recommendation systems enhances customer-level outcomes, such as views and sales of recommended products, clickthrough rate, and conversion. More importantly, the marginal impacts of the recommendation system are significantly higher for mobile users, indicating that the higher search costs imposed through mobile devices are more effectively reduced through recommendation systems. With respect to sales diversity, we observe that although the mobile channel leads to more diverse sales, we see no interaction effects of the recommendation system and mobile use on sales diversity. These results provide boundary conditions for the efficacy of recommendation systems in retail contexts where online sales occur across both PC-based and mobile channels. We discuss the managerial implications of these results for online retailers and conclude with opportunities for further research.},

We tag theory-driven attributes of 37,125 unique products via Amazon Mechanical Turk to augment the usual product data (e.g., review ratings, descriptions). By examining the recommender's impact through different stages\textemdash awareness (views), salience (conversion|views), and final conversion\textemdash and across product types, we provide nuanced insights. The study confirms that the recommender increases views, conversion|views, and final conversion rates by 15.3\%, 21.6\%, and 7.5\%, respectively, but this lift is moderated by product attributes and review ratings. We find that the lift on product views is greater for utilitarian products compared with hedonic products as well as for experience products compared with search products. In contrast, the lift on conversion|views rate is greater for hedonic products compared with utilitarian products. Furthermore, the lift on views rate is greater for products with higher average review ratings, which suggests that a recommender acts as a complement to review ratings, whereas the opposite is true for conversion|views, where recommender and review ratings are substitutes. Additionally, a recommender's awareness lift is greater than its saliency impact. We discuss the potential mechanisms behind our results as well as their managerial implications.},

We use data from a randomized field experiment run on the website of a top retailer in North America across 82,290 products and 1,138,238 users. We report four main findings. First, we demonstrate and quantify across a wide range of product categories that the use of traditional collaborative filters (CFs) is associated with a decrease in sales diversity relative to a world without product recommendations. Furthermore, the design of the CF matters. CFs based on purchase data are associated with a greater effect size than those based on product views. Second, the decrease in aggregate sales diversity may not always be accompanied by a corresponding decrease in individual-level consumption diversity. In fact, it is even possible for individual consumption diversity to increase while aggregate sales diversity decreases. Third, copurchase network analyses show that while recommenders can help individuals explore new products, similar users still end up exploring the same kinds of products, resulting in concentration bias at the aggregate level. Fourth and finally, there is a difference between absolute and relative impact on niche items. Specifically, absolute sales and views for niche items in fact increase, but their gains are smaller compared with the gains in views and sales for popular items. Thus, whereas niche items gain in absolute terms, they lose out in terms of market share. We discuss economic impacts and managerial implications.},

  abstract = {Most recommender systems generate recommendations to match the user's current preference. However, users sometimes might have the goal to develop new preferences away from their current preference and use the recommender to guide them towards it. In this paper, we asked users to select a new genre to explore and studied what kind of recommendations would be more helpful for users to start exploring this new music taste. Three different recommendation methods are tested: one non-personalized which recommends the most representative tracks of the genre, one personalized method which considers songs from the new genre that best matches users' current preferences, and one mixed method which makes a trade-off between the two approaches. A comparative design was used in a user experiment in which participants were asked to evaluate the differences between the personalized method/mixed method and the non-personalized baseline. The mixed method results in recommendations that are more accurate and representative for the new genre than the personalized method. Users' perceived helpfulness for exploring the new genre is positively related to both perceived accuracy and perceived representativeness of the recommended items. Besides, recommendations from the mixed method are perceived more helpful for users high on Musical Sophistication Index for Active Engagement (MSAE). To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies using a recommender system to support users' preference development, and provides insights in how recommender systems can help users attain new goals and tastes.},

In the studies presented here, however, the authors contend that this phenomenon may be restricted to stylized product representations in which every product dimension is represented by a number (e.g., a toaster oven that has a durability rating of 7.2 and ease of cleaning rating of 5.5). Such effects do not typically occur when consumers experience the product (e.g., taste a drink) or when even one of the product attributes is represented perceptually (e.g., differently priced hotel rooms whose quality is depicted with a photo). The authors posit that perceptual representations of attributes do not support the sorts of comparisons that drive the attraction effect with highly stylized examples, and they question the practical significance of the effect.},

These systems encounter some problems the major of which is their failure in recommending long tail items. Long tail items are the ones rated by a few users, thus, their rare participation in recommendations. To overcome this problem, it is necessary to provide recommendations by considering other aspects in addition to accuracy. One of these aspects is diversity in recommendations. As to different users who may prefer different levels of diversity in recommendations, here diversification of recommendations in a personalized manner is suggested in order to increase the participation of long tail items. The recommendation list is optimized based on three objectives of increasing the accuracy, personalizing the diversity, and reducing the popularity of the recommended items to meet the purpose. The defined multi-objective optimization problem is solved through the archived multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm. The evaluation of this proposed method on the Netflix datasets reveals that this method overcomes the long tail recommendation problem and diversifies the recommendations according to user needs while maintaining an acceptable level of accuracy.},

Providing more user control is interesting to enable end-users to help steer the recommendation process with additional input and feedback. However, different users may have different preferences with regard to such control. To the best of our knowledge, no research has investigated the effect of personal characteristics on visual control techniques in the music recommendation domain. In this paper, we present results of a user study on the web using two different visualisation techniques (a radar chart and sliders) that allows users to control Spotify recommendations. A within-subject design with Latin Square counterbalancing measures was used for the study. Results indicate that the radar chart helped the participants discover a significantly higher number of new songs compared to the sliders. We also found that users' experience with Spotify had an influence on their interaction with different musical attributes. The participants who used Spotify frequently and users with a high individual musical sophistication interacted with the attributes significantly more with the radar chart compared to the sliders. Individual musical sophistication also had a significant impact on their interaction with the interaction techniques. The participants with high musical sophistication interacted significantly more with the radar chart in comparison to the sliders. Based on the feedback from our participants, we provide design suggestions to further improve user control in music recommendation.},

Using a scenario method, respondents were randomly assigned to one of ten different scenarios (2destination types \^A 5choice sets). The results of this study showed that having more than 22 choices increased the likelihood of making `no choice,' regardless of destination type, suggesting that choice overload exists in the tourism industry. This study also demonstrated that when fewer than 22 choices were provided participants who made a choice perceived less regret than those who made `no choice'. However, the opposite results were found when tourists were provided with too many choices. Further discussion and implications are provided in the main body of this paper.},

First, we introduce an interactive Venn diagram visualization, which combined with sliders, can provide an efficient visual paradigm for information filtering. Second, we provide a three-fold evaluation of the user experience: objective metrics, subjective user perception, and behavioral measures. Through the analysis of these metrics, we confirmed results from recent studies, such as the effect of trusting propensity on accepting the recommendations and also unveiled the importance of features such as being a native speaker.

The recommender systems tailored to leverage contextual information (such as location, time, companion or such) in the recommendation process are called context-aware recommender systems. This paper presents a review on the continual development of context-aware recommender systems by analyzing different kinds of contexts without limiting to any specific application domain. First, an in-depth analysis is conducted on different recommendation algorithms used in context-aware recommender systems. Then this information is used to find out that how these techniques deals with the curse of dimensionality, which is an inherent issue in such systems. Since contexts are primarily based on users' activity patterns that leads to the development of personalized recommendation services for the users. Thus, this paper also presents a review on how this contextual information is represented (either explicitly or implicitly) in the recommendation process. We also presented a list of datasets and evaluation metrics used in the setting of CARS. We tried to highlight that how algorithmic approaches used in CARS differ from those of conventional RS. In that, we presented what modification or additions are being applied on the top of conventional recommendation approaches to produce context-aware recommendations.

In three studies with a total of 598 participants, we systematically investigated the moderating impact of choice set sizes, option attractiveness, and whether participants had to justify their choices. We also tested the moderating role of search behavior, domain-specific expertise, and participants' tendency to maximize, in a within-subject design.

As mobile technologies become increasingly powerful, richer modes of presentation (e.g., videos and animated pictures) are used to design mobile online shops resulting in increased visual complexity. Given the importance of fluent mobile web site processing during typically short interactive sessions and the need to bridge a gap in prior research, this article explores the effects of perceived visual complexity on consumers' perceptions and behavior-related intentions when using mobile online shops. The findings from two empirical studies (i.e., an online survey and an experimental study) conducted among mobile device-using online shoppers illustrate that perceived visual complexity negatively influences individuals' satisfaction with their mobile shopping experience, whereas their channel-specific satisfaction enhances their loyalty to the online retailer. Customers' perceived psychological costs (i.e., time and effort costs as well as spatial crowding perceptions) partially mediate the relationship between visual complexity perceptions and satisfaction. As the results of the laboratory experiment show, the mediating role of perceived spatial crowding in the relationship between perceived visual complexity and satisfaction depends on the mobile device individuals use to visit an online shop. Hence, this relationship is mediated by perceptions of spatial crowding only when online shop visitors use a smartphone rather than a tablet. \textcopyright{} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Sometimes we desire change, a break from the same, or an opportunity to fulfill different aspects of our needs. Noting that consumers seek variety, several approaches have been developed to diversify items recommended by personalized recommender systems. However, current diversification strategies operate under a one-shot paradigm without considering the evolution of preferences resulting from recent consumption. Therefore, such methods often sacrifice accuracy. In the context of online media, we show that by recognizing that consumption in a session is the result of a sequence of utility-maximizing selections from various categories, one can increase recommendation accuracy by dynamically tailoring the diversity of suggested items to the diversity sought by the consumer. Our approach is based on a multicategory utility model that captures a consumer's preference for different categories of content, how quickly the consumer satiates with one category and wishes to substitute it with another, and how the consumer trades off costly search efforts with selecting from a recommended list to discover new content. Taken together, these three elements allow us to characterize how an individual selects a diverse set of items to consume over the course of a session and how likely the individual is to click on recommended content. We estimate the model using a clickstream data set from a large media outlet and apply it to determine the most relevant content to recommend at different stages of an online session. We find that our approach generates recommendations that are on average about 10\% more accurate than optimized alternatives and about 25\% more accurate than those diversified using existing diversification strategies. Moreover, the proposed method recommends content with diversity that more closely matches the diversity sought by readers, exhibiting lower concentration\textendash diversification bias than other personalized recommender systems. Using a policy simulation, we estimate that recommending content using the proposed approach would result in visitors reading 23\% additional articles at the studied website and deriving 35\% higher utility. This could lead to immediate gains in revenue for the publisher and longer-term improvements in customer satisfaction and retention at the site.},

A field deployment with 1,950 users showed that users found the tool useful for a variety of exploration and short-term recommendation tasks, even preferring it to existing interfaces for several tasks. Experimentation with several design features found that the actual user navigation algorithms were significant (user satisfaction was lower for algorithms with faked controls) and that offering positive and negative feedback options led to increased feedback and user retention.},

The resulting model achieves an 89\% predictive accuracy using historical data. A unique aspect of the model is the incorporation of self-competence, where the model defers when it cannot reasonably make a recommendation. We then compare the performance of the Next Likely Destination model in a real-life consumer study with 35,000 actual airline customers. In the user study, the model obtains a 51\% predictive accuracy. What happened? The Individual Behavior Framework theory provides insights into possibly explaining this inconsistency in evaluation outcomes. Research results indicate that algorithmic approaches in competitive industries must account for shifting customer preferences, changes to the travel environment, and confounding business effects rather than relying solely on historical data.},

Both visualisations do this by connecting profile preferences with a filtered recommendation space. We compare and contrast the two visualisations in a live user study (n = 70). The results suggest that, although users can understand both visualisations, chord diagrams are particularly effective in helping users to identify blind-spots, while simpler bar charts are better for conveying what was already known in a profile. Evaluating the understandability of blind-spot visualizations is a first step toward using visual explanations to help address a criticism of recommender systems: that personalising information creates filter bubbles.},

From an organizational point of view, however, the more important issue is how managers make informed decisions about interventions that can lead to greater acceptance and effective utilization of IT. There is limited research in the IT implementation literature that deals with the role of interventions to aid such managerial decision making. Particularly, there is a need to understand how various interventions can influence the known determinants of IT adoption and use. To address this gap in the literature, we draw from the vast body of research on the technology acceptance model (TAM), particularly the work on the determinants of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, and: (i) develop a comprehensive nomological network (integrated model) of the determinants of individual level (IT) adoption and use; (ii) empirically test the proposed integrated model; and (iii) present a research agenda focused on potential pre- and postimplementation interventions that can enhance employees' adoption and use of IT. Our findings and research agenda have important implications for managerial decision making on IT implementation in organizations.},

In this paper, we propose integer programming-based approaches to build decision trees for the algorithm selection problem. These techniques allow the automation of three crucial decisions: (a) discerning the most important problem features to determine problem classes, (b) grouping the problems into classes, and (c) selecting the best algorithm configuration for each class. To evaluate this new approach, extensive computational experiments were executed using the linear programming algorithms implemented in the COIN-OR branch-and-cut solver across a comprehensive set of instances, including all MIPLIB benchmark instances. The results exceeded our expectations. While selecting the single best parameter setting across all instances decreased the total running time by 22\%, our approach decreased the total running time by 40\% on average across 10-fold cross-validation experiments. These results indicate that our method generalizes quite well and does not overfit.},

With the rise of financial technology (FinTech), which uses mobile devices and applications as promotional platforms, biometrics has the important role of strengthening the identification of such applications for security. However, users still have privacy and trust concerns about biometrics. Previous studies have demonstrated that the technology acceptance model (TAM) can rigorously explain and predict user acceptance of new technologies. This study therefore modifies the TAM as a basic research architecture. Based on a literature review, we add two new variables, namely, ``perceived privacy'' and ``perceived trust,'' to extend the traditional TAM to examine user acceptance of biometric identification in FinTech applications. First, we apply the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to evaluate the defined objects and relevant criteria of the research framework. Second, we use the AHP results in the scenario analysis to explore biometric identification methods that correspond to objects and criteria. The results indicate that face and voice recognition are the two most preferred identifica-tion methods in FinTech applications. In addition, there are significant changes in the results of the perceived trust and perceived privacy dominant scenarios.},

In order to answer these research questions, we conducted a between-subjects online experiment, informed by MAIN Model (Sundar, 2008), which posits that interface cues signaling different types of sources can influence perceived credibility of content by triggering distinct cognitive heuristics. Participants were assigned to a scenario wherein the expert review contrasted the peer rating about recommending photos for business profiles, with systematic variations in expert review valence (negative vs. positive), expert identity (ingroup vs. outgroup vs. no identity), and agent type (human vs. AI). Results show that positive ratings are more influential on user judgements. However, for negative ratings, human ingroup members generated greater effects than no-identity experts. Moreover, AI systems were as influential as human experts, suggesting the potential for AI to substitute human experts for online recommendations.},

RAs have the potential to support and improve the quality of the decisions consumers make when searching for and selecting products online. They can reduce the information overload facing consumers, as well as the complexity of online searches. Prior research on RAs has focused mostly on developing and evaluating different underlying algorithms that generate recommendations. This paper instead identifies other important aspects of RAs, namely RA use, RA characteristics, provider credibility, and factors related to product, user, and user-RA interaction, which influence users' decision-making processes and outcomes, as well as their evaluation of RAs. It goes beyond generalized models, such as TAM, and identifies the RA-specific features, such as RA input, process, and output design characteristics, that affect users' evaluations, including their assessments of the usefulness and ease-of-use of RA applications. Based on a review of existing literature on e-commerce RAs, this paper develops a conceptual model with 28 propositions derived from five theoretical perspectives. The propositions help answer the two research questions: (1) How do RA use, RA characteristics, and other factors influence consumer decision making processes and outcomes? (2) How do RA use, RA characteristics, and other factors influence users' evaluations of RAs? By identifying the critical gaps between what we know and what we need to know, this paper identifies potential areas of future research for scholars. It also provides advice to information systems practitioners concerning the effective design and development of RAs.},

While context effects are well explored in the marketing and psychology literature, very little work has been done on incorporating these effects in discrete choice and investigating revenue management problems in their presence. In this paper, we introduce a new Random Utility Maximization choice model, the ``Contextual MNL'' model, that incorporates these effects. In our model, the utility of a presented item to the customer depends on what other items are offered beside it in an assortment. We compare the prediction power of our choice model and some of the other widely used choice models in the literature on a real data set and show that incorporating the context effects may significantly enhance the prediction scores and our understanding of the patterns of choice selection. We show the NP-hardness of the assortment optimization problem and the click through rate optimization problem, under our choice model. Several polynomially solvable special cases of the model are identified that also perform well in our empirical validation for our data set. In addition, to derive approximation results, we obtain some conditions for monotonicity and submodularity of the objective function of the assortment optimization and click through rate maximization problems. We also develop fast heuristics for solving the assortment optimization problem which provide near-optimal solutions according to our test results.},

  abstract = {Online product recommendations have been shown to influence consumers' preferences and purchasing behaviors for recommended products. However, it remains an open empirical question whether and how recommendations of other products affect a consumer's economic behavior for a focal product. In many e-commerce websites, a product is presented with co-purchase and co-view recommendations, which potentially contain complementary and substitutable products, respectively. Very little research has explored differential effects of recommending complementary and substitutable products. In this study, we explore how types of other recommended products impact consumers' willingness to pay for a focal product through interactions with prices of recommended products and consumers' decision stages. We conducted a 23 randomized factorial experiment as well as two 2 \texttimes{} 2 experiments to examine these issues. Experimental results provide evidence that there is a significant interaction effect between the recommendation type and decision stage, which highlights the importance of recommendation timing on e-commerce platforms. Furthermore, it also illustrates that the effect of recommending complementary vs. substitutable products is subject to contextual factors such as consumers' decision stages. Results of our study have significant implications for the design and application of online recommender systems.},

The proposed agent-based simulation approach allows for comprehensive analysis of longitudinal recommender systems performance under a variety of diverse conditions, which typically is not feasible with live real-world systems. We specifically focus on exploring the product consumption strategies and show that, over time, user\textendash recommender interactions consistently lead to the longitudinal performance paradox of recommender systems. In particular, users' reliance on the system's recommendations to make item choices generally tends to make the recommender system less useful in the long run or, more specifically, negatively impacts the longitudinal dynamics of several important dimensions of recommendation performance. Furthermore, we explore the nuances of the performance paradox via additional explorations of longitudinal dynamics of recommender systems for a variety of user populations and consumption strategies, as well as personalized and nonpersonalized recommendation approaches. One interesting discovery from our exploration is that a certain hybrid consumption strategy\textemdash that is, where users rely on a combination of both personalized- and popularity-based recommendations, offers a unique ability to substantially improve consumption relevance over time. In other words, for such hybrid consumption settings, recommendation algorithms facilitate the general ``quality-rises-to-the-top'' phenomenon, which is not present in the pure popularity-based consumption. In addition to discussing a number of interesting performance patterns, the paper also analyzes and provides insights into the underlying factors that drive such patterns.

  abstract = {Explainable recommendation attempts to develop models that generate not only high-quality recommendations but also intuitive explanations. The explanations may either be post-hoc or directly come from an explainable model (also called interpretable or transparent model in some contexts). Explainable recommendation tries to address the problem of why: by providing explanations to users or system designers, it helps humans to understand why certain items are recommended by the algorithm, where the human can either be users or system designers. Explainable recommendation helps to improve the transparency, persuasiveness, effectiveness, trustworthiness, and satisfaction of recommendation systems. It also facilitates system designers for better system debugging. In recent years, a large number of explainable recommendation approaches -- especially model-based methods -- have been proposed and applied in real-world systems. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review for the explainable recommendation research. We first highlight the position of explainable recommendation in recommender system research by categorizing recommendation problems into the 5W, i.e., what, when, who, where, and why. We then conduct a comprehensive survey of explainable recommendation on three perspectives: 1) We provide a chronological research timeline of explainable recommendation. 2) We provide a two-dimensional taxonomy to classify existing explainable recommendation research. 3) We summarize how explainable recommendation applies to different recommendation tasks. We also devote a chapter to discuss the explanation perspectives in broader IR and AI/ML research. We end the survey by discussing potential future directions to promote the explainable recommendation research area and beyond.},

However, existing studies rarely examine behavioral outputs (e.g., marginal effects and elasticities) that can be derived from machine-learning models and compare the results with those obtained from logit models. In other words, there has not been a comprehensive comparison between logit models and machine learning that covers both prediction and behavioral analysis, two equally important subjects in travel-behavior study. This paper addresses this gap by examining the key differences in model development, evaluation, and behavioral interpretation between logit and machine-learning models for mode-choice modeling. We empirically evaluate the two approaches using stated-preference survey data. Consistent with the literature, this paper finds that the bestperforming machine-learning model, random forest, has significantly higher predictive accuracy than multinomial logit and mixed logit models. The random forest model and the two logit models largely agree on several aspects of the behavioral outputs, including variable importance and the direction of association between independent variables and mode choice. However, we find that the random forest model produces behaviorally unreasonable arc elasticities and marginal effects when these behavioral outputs are computed from a standard approach. After the introduction of some modifications that overcome the limitations of tree-based models, the results are improved to some extent. There appears to be a tradeoff between predictive accuracy and behavioral soundness when choosing between machine learning and logit models in mode-choice modeling.},

  abstract = {Research studies have shown that recommender systems' predictions that are observed by users can cause biases in users' post-consumption preference ratings. Because users' preference ratings are typically fed back to the system as training data for future predictions, this process is likely to influence the performance of the system in the long run. We use a simulation approach to study the longitudinal impact of preference biases (and their magnitude) on the dynamics of recommender systems' performance. We look at the influence of preference biases in two conditions: (i) during the normal system use, where biases are typically caused by the system's inherent prediction errors, and (ii) in the presence of external (deliberate) recommendation perturbations. Our simulation results show that preference biases significantly impair the system's prediction performance (i.e., prediction accuracy) as well as users' consumption outcomes (i.e., consumption relevance and diversity) over time. The impact is non-linear to the size of the bias, i.e., large bias causes disproportionately large negative effects. Also, items that are less popular and less distinctive (in terms of their content) are affected more by preference biases. Additionally, intentional recommendation perturbations, even on a small number of items for a short time, substantially amplify the negative impact of preference bias on a system's longitudinal dynamics and causes long-lasting effects on users' consumption. Our findings provide important implications for the design of recommender systems.},

 abstract = {Information technology (IT) acceptance research has yielded many competing models, each with different sets of acceptance determinants. In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.},
