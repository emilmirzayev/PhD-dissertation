	abstract = {Clustering data by identifying a subset of representative examples is important for processing sensory signals and detecting patterns in data. Such ``exemplars'' can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called ``affinity propagation,'' which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.},

@article{dowlingEtAl20,
	abstract = {Psychology and economics (together known as behavioral economics) are two prominent disciplines underlying many theories in marketing. The extensive marketing literature documents consumers'nonrational behavior even though behavioral biases might not always be consistently termed or formally described. In this review, we identify and synthesize empirical research on behavioral biases in marketing. We document the key findings according to three classes of deviations (i.e., nonstandard preferences, nonstandard beliefs, and nonstandard decision making) and the four phases of consumer purchase decision making (i.e., need recognition, pre-purchase, purchase, and post-purchase). Our organizing framework allows us to (1) synthesize instructive marketing papers in a concise and meaningful manner and (2) identify connections and differences within and across categories in both dimensions. In our review, we discuss specific implications for management and avenues for future research.},

	abstract = {While the attraction effect has received considerable attention in consumer research, recent research concludes that the effect is restricted to artificial choice settings, which questions its relevance for marketing practice. This paper takes a broader perspective on the issue of the generalizability of research results and introduces a set of background factors, which, if neglected, have adverse consequences for such generalizability. The results of our extensive review of the literature on this topic, published during the last four decades in the top 30 marketing journals, show that context effect studies have routinely neglected these background factors. In light of our results, we propose guidelines for implementing context effect experiments in future consumer research. These guidelines allow for a more realistic analysis of the attraction effect and related context effects in consumer research.},

@article{kahnemanTversky79,
	abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.},

@inproceedings{tomlinsonBenson21,
	abstract = {Individuals are constantly making choices---purchasing products, consuming Web content, making social connections---so understanding what contributes to these decisions is crucial in many settings. A major interest is understanding context effects, which occur when the set of available options itself affects an individual's relative preferences. These violate traditional rationality assumptions but are commonly observed in human behavior. At the same time, identifying context effects from choice data remains a challenge; existing models posit a specific context effect a priori and then measure its effect from (often effect-targeting) data. Here, we develop discrete choice models that capture a broad range of context effects, which are learned from choice data rather than baked into the model. Our models yield intuitive, interpretable, and statistically testable context effects, all while being simple to train. We evaluate our model on several empirical choice datasets, discovering, e.g., that people are more willing to book higher-priced hotels when presented with options that are on sale. We also provide the first analysis of context effects in online social network growth, finding that users forming connections place relatively more emphasis on shared neighbors when popular users are an option.},

@article{chernev04,
	abstract = {{Consumers often make decisions based on the extremeness of choice alternatives. Prior research has argued that extremeness aversion is a function of the relational properties of choice alternatives and that the middle option, defined such that its attribute values are between the values of the other alternatives, is always viewed as the least extreme, compromise option. The attribute-balance hypothesis advanced in this article extends prior research, demonstrating that extremeness aversion is also a function of the dispersion of attribute values within each alternative. In particular, it is argued that an option with equal attribute ratings will be perceived as the compromise alternative even when it is not the middle option. Data from three studies support this prediction, offering converging evidence for the attribute-balance effect in different decision contexts. Theoretical implications of the findings are discussed in the context of the extant extremeness aversion research.}},

@article{drolet02,
	abstract = {{The present research demonstrates that consumers tend to vary their use of decision rules independent of option and set characteristics. In five experiments, increased choice of a particular option (e.g., lower price, brand name, or compromise option) was associated with relatively decreased choice of that same (generic) option on occasions that followed. Results indicate that this inherent rule variability is not an effect of background contrast but instead relates to consumers' favorable valuation of decision change itself. This research implies that the idea of contingent decision making applies not only to decision outcomes but also to decision processes.}},

@article{wollschlaegerDiederich20,
	abstract = {{Preference reversals---a decision maker prefers A over B in one situation but B over A in another---demonstrate that human behavior violates invariance assumptions of (utility-based) rational choice theories. In the field of multi-alternative multi-attribute decision-making research, 3 preference reversals received special attention: similarity, attraction, and compromise effects. The 3 so-called context effects are changes in (relative) choice probabilities for 2 choice alternatives after a third ``decoy'' option is added to the set. Despite their simplicity, the effects demonstrate that choice probabilities in multi-alternative decision making are contingent on the local context, that is, on the choice set under consideration. Because of their simplicity, on the other hand, similarity, attraction, and compromise effects have been successfully examined in numerous studies to date, and they have become of increasing interest for differentiating between computational cognitive process models of multi-alternative multi-attribute decision making. However, the stimulus arrangement for producing the effects seems to vary between studies, which becomes challenging when model accounts are compared. The purpose of this review is to present various paradigms in a coherent way and describe various model accounts based on a common structure.}},

In the experiments reported here, we showed that these effects also arise in simple perceptual-decision-making tasks. This finding casts doubt on explanations limited to consumer choice and high-level decisions, and it indicates that context effects may be amenable to a general explanation at the level of the basic decision process. We demonstrated for the first time that three important context effects from the preferential-choice literature---similarity, attraction, and compromise effects---all occurred within a single perceptual-decision task. Not only do our results challenge previous explanations for context effects proposed by consumer researchers, but they also challenge the choice rules assumed in theories of perceptual decision making. },

@article{kivetz04,
	abstract = { The compromise effect denotes the finding that brands gain share when they become the intermediate rather than extreme option in a choice set. Despite the robustness and importance of this phenomenon, choice modelers have neglected to incorporate the compromise effect in formal choice models and to test whether such models outperform the standard value maximization model. In this article, the authors suggest four context-dependent choice models that can conceptually capture the compromise effect. Although the models are motivated by theory from economics and behavioral decision research, they differ with respect to the particular mechanism that underlies the compromise effect (e.g., contextual concavity versus loss aversion). Using two empirical applications, the authors (1) contrast the alternative models and show that incorporating the compromise effect by modeling the local choice context leads to superior predictions and fit compared with the traditional value maximization model and a stronger (naive) model that adjusts for possible biases in utility measurement, (2) generalize the compromise effect by demonstrating that it systematically affects choice in larger sets of products and attributes than has been previously shown, (3) show the theoretical and empirical equivalence of loss aversion and local (contextual) concavity and (4) demonstrate the superiority of models that use a single reference point over ``tournament models'' in which each option serves as a reference point. They discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this research as well as the ability of the proposed models to predict other behavioral context effects. },

	abstract = { In this article, the author proposes and applies an empirical two-stage choice model to Internet clickstream data that captures observed choices for two choice stages: products viewed and products purchased. The model allows for interdependences between choices within a stage as well as the use of varying decision rules in each stage. The author accommodates heterogeneity in preferences and in decision rules. The proposed model uses observed choices to infer both attribute preference ratings and criterion attributes. The results show empirically, in a field setting, that the product attributes evaluated in Stage 1 differ from those evaluated in Stage 2. Consistent with existing theory, consumers tend to use simpler decision rules based on a subset of attribute information in earlier stages. The author also finds some preliminary evidence that attributes such as price and size tend to be considered in only one of the two stages, whereas ingredient attributes tend to be considered in both stages. From a managerial perspective, the identification of criterion attributes, coupled with the preference parameters estimated by the model, can assist with the targeting and positioning of promotional strategies. },

@article{roodrkerkEtAl11,
	abstract = { The behavioral literature provides ample evidence that consumer preferences are partly driven by the context provided by the set of alternatives. Three important context effects are the compromise, attraction, and similarity effects. Because these context effects affect choices in a systematic and predictable way, it should be possible to incorporate them in a choice model. However, the literature does not offer such a choice model. This study fills this gap by proposing a discrete-choice model that decomposes a product's utility into a context-free partworth utility and a context-dependent component capturing all three context effects. Model estimation results on choice-based conjoint data involving digital cameras provide convincing statistical evidence for context effects. The estimated context effects are consistent with the predictions from the behavioral literature, and accounting for context effects leads to better predictions both in and out of sample. To illustrate the benefit from incorporating context effects in a choice model, the authors discuss how firms could utilize the context sensitivity of consumers to design more profitable product lines. },

	abstract = { Consumer research has documented dozens of instances in which the introduction of an ``irrelevant'' third option affects preferences between the remaining two. In nearly all such cases, the unattractive dominated option enhances the attractiveness of the option it most resembles---a phenomenon known as the ``attraction effect.'' In the studies presented here, however, the authors contend that this phenomenon may be restricted to stylized product representations in which every product dimension is represented by a number (e.g., a toaster oven that has a durability rating of 7.2 and ease of cleaning rating of 5.5). Such effects do not typically occur when consumers experience the product (e.g., taste a drink) or when even one of the product attributes is represented perceptually (e.g., differently priced hotel rooms whose quality is depicted with a photo). The authors posit that perceptual representations of attributes do not support the sorts of comparisons that drive the attraction effect with highly stylized examples, and they question the practical significance of the effect. },

Choice probabilities derived with independent errors have the property of independence of irrelevant alternatives, which often does not match observed substitution behavior and leads to inaccurate calculations of source of volume when new entrants are introduced. In this article, the authors parameterize the covariance matrix for a probit model so that similar brands in the preference space have higher correlation than dissimilar brands, resulting in higher rates of substitution. They find across multiple data sets that similarity based on overall utility, not just attributes, defines products as similar with heightened rates of substitution. The proposed model results in better in-sample and predictive fits to the data and more realistic measures of substitution for a new product introduction. },

They propose that context effects resulting from the addition of a third option to a two-option set are more frequently observed when the added option is relatively similar (adjacent) to the ``disadvantaged'' alternative (i.e., the lower-share option) in the set.

@article{orhun09,
	abstract = { In a market of consumers with varying willingness to pay, using product line as a discrimination tool may extract higher profits than serving all consumers with a single product. Local context effects, however, point to yet another consideration in designing product lines: how the appeal of a product changes with the context provided by other products in the choice set. I present a model of product line design that incorporates both discrimination and context management goals and offers recommendations for the variety and positioning of products. To this end, the model makes use of a framework that allows preferences to be choice set dependent. Given this framework, I study how the firm manages externalities between products created by such dependencies. The firm creates distortions above and beyond those resulting from discrimination motives alone. For example, in a vertically differentiated market for quality, quality distortions exist even for the consumers with the highest valuations. The range of quality provisions, given the number of products, is compressed as the relative importance of unfavorable comparisons among products increases. Surprisingly, this compression may even lead the firm to forego discrimination among consumers regardless of the cost of offering distinct products. },

Despite its simplicity and intuitive appeal, there is a growing body of data that is inconsistent with this theory. In particular, the relative attractiveness of x compared to y often depends on the presence or absence of a third option z, and the ``market share'' of an option can actually be increased by enlarging the offered set. We review recent empirical findings that are inconsistent with value maximization, and present a context-dependent model that expresses the value of each option as an additive combination of two components: a contingent weighting process that captures the effect of the background context, and a binary comparison process that describes the effect of the local context. The model accounts for observed violations of the standard theory and provides a framework for analyzing context-dependent preferences. },

However, such product recommendations can not only support but also influence decision-making and outcomes. Expanding on previous research on the persuasiveness of product recommendations, this paper demonstrates that recommender systems can affect online decision-making through an anchoring effect such that consumers' decision-making processes and, ultimately, choices are biased toward numerical attributes of (even random) product recommendations; we refer to this phenomenon as attribute-level anchoring effect. The findings of the current research reveal that this effect occurs because consumers tend to pay more attention to alternatives that are similar to a recommended option. From a practical perspective, these results indicate the potential to shape consumer interests and choices through recommender systems and highlight possible customer protection issues in online shopping environments.},

	abstract = {Several studies have shown that consumer choice is often influenced by the context or the set of alternatives under consideration. Context effects have largely been explained in terms of constructive preferences that are consistent with 2 theoretical accounts---effort minimization and perceptual contrast---that emphasize different underlying motivations. We propose that the effect of time pressure on context effects can be used as a moderating variable to determine which of the 2 motives is supported. Specifically, if context effects bias preferences due to effort minimization, time pressure should increase the magnitude of such effects. In contrast, if context effects arise due to an excessive focus on the relational characteristics of the alternatives provided, time pressure should reduce the magnitude of such effects. We examine this proposition in relation to the compromise effect and a choice between an extreme and an all-average option. We find that the compromise effect and the preference for an all-average alternative are both reduced under time pressure. A study using Mouselab provides additional support for the underlying decision mechanisms. We discuss the theoretical implications of this research and explore its consequences for marketers.},

This research examines how maximizing affects the compromise effect: the preference for an option with relatively intermediate attribute values. Results show that maximizers attempt to maximize gains on all attributes (rather than to rely on a single, most important attribute as satisficers do) and make more compensatory tradeoffs, which leads to more often choosing a compromise option (Studies 2 \& 3). Results held whether maximization was measured as an individual difference variable (Studies 1 \& 2) or activated as a decision mindset (Study 3). When asked to make decisions for a (fictional) prototypical maximizer, however, people intuited fewer compromise choices (Study 4).

	abstract = {Since the introduction of Discrete Choice Analysis, countless efforts have been made to enhance the efficiency of data collection through choice experiments and to improve the behavioural realism of choice models. One example development in data collection are best-worst discrete choice experiments (BWDCE), which have the benefit of obtaining a larger number of observations per respondent, allowing for reliably estimating choice models even with smaller samples. In SWDCE, respondents are asked to alternatingly select the `best'/`worst' alternatives, until the choice set is exhausted. The use of BWDCE raises the question of decision-rule consistency through the stages of the experiment. We challenge the notion that the same fully compensatory decision rule is utilised throughout the experiment. We hypothesize that respondents may utilise one decision rule for selecting the `best' and another for selecting the `worst' alternatives. To test our hypothesis, we developed a model that combines the SBWMNL model for modelling best-worst data and the μRRM model that can account for variations in decision rules. Our results show that decision-rule heterogeneity does seem to be present in BWDCE: it is more likely that `best' choices are made using a fully compensatory decision rule (maximising utility), whereas `worst' choices are more likely made using a non-compensatory decision rule (minimising regret). Such behaviour is largely similar to how image theory describes the decision-making process in complex situations. Our findings give choice modellers new insight into the behaviour of respondents in best-worst experiments and allows them to represent their behaviour more accurately.},

We examine why knowledge worker ego networks are structured as they are, but also why and how knowledge worker networks change over time. We examine two changes to knowledge workers' ego networks: the addition of new direct exchange partners and the deletion of existing direct exchange partners. Our study offers important evidence that two network dimensions (tie strength between ego and his or her alters, and the level of connectivity among ego's alters) provide distinctive insight into how networks change. Importantly, our study provides evidence that three critical components of the knowledge creation process---access to diverse and redundant resources, shared experiences and tacit mutual understanding to develop the resources, and previous knowledge creations---act as causal mechanisms behind network changes in subsequent periods. Our study is at the individual level as we study biomedical research scientists and their direct exchange partners---the others to whom they are directly connected through coauthorship. },

	abstract = {Abstract In recent decades, co-authorship and policies aimed at inducing academic collaboration have increased simultaneously. Assuming that intellectual collaboration is exogenously determined, prior studies found a negative relationship between co-authorship and productivity. I examine a panel data on economists publishing from 1970 to 2011 to test the causal effect of intellectual collaboration on intellectual output. As characteristics of the individual and her opportunity set are endogenously related to both collaboration and productivity, I instrument the amount of co-authorship by the common research interest between an author and her potential co-authors. After controlling for endogenous co-authorship formation, unobservable heterogeneity and time varying factors, the effect of intellectual collaboration on individual performance becomes positive.},

abstract = {Abstract This study investigates the role of consideration sets in brand choice. Brand-level aggregated data are used to capture the responses of consumers who face a number of international and domestic brands in markets rather than two or three brands in experimental designs, as in Chaudhuri and Holbrook (2001). Empirical evidence from path analysis shows that the consideration set for hedonic products includes a smaller number of dominant brands, whereas the consideration set for utilitarian products includes more and diverse brands. The probability of being finally chosen from the consideration set differs according to product characteristics: hedonic vs. utilitarian. The authors discuss managerial implications and suggestions for future research. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
